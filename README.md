üìù Description

**ESPHomeGUIeasy** is a standalone desktop application written in Python with a modern PyQt6 interface, designed to simplify how you create, configure, and deploy firmware for **ESPHome-compatible devices** (ESP32, ESP8266, etc.).

It provides a full **visual workflow** ‚Äî from device configuration to firmware flashing ‚Äî with no need to write YAML manually (but you can if you want to).

Whether you're a beginner in home automation or a power user managing multiple devices, ESPHomeGUIeasy makes the process easier, faster, and more organized.

### üí° Key Features

- üß± **Visual ‚Äúblock-style‚Äù editor**  
  Drag & drop preconfigured sensor/action blocks ‚Äî no YAML syntax needed

- ‚úçÔ∏è **Live YAML preview & editing**  
  The interface updates YAML as you go ‚Äî and you can still tweak it manually

- üñ•Ô∏è **Cross-platform UI**  
  Clean and responsive PyQt6-based GUI, available in multiple languages (EN, IT, ES, DE)

- üìÑ **Project Manager** *(new in v1.4.0)*  
  Organize projects by category with metadata, changelogs, and quick actions

- üîå **Integrated Flashing**  
  Supports USB and OTA uploads with built-in log viewer

- üß∞ **Console with build logs**  
  Real-time output while building and flashing firmware

- üíæ **No external setup required**  
  Works out of the box ‚Äî no need to install Python or ESPHome manually

---

**ESPHomeGUIeasy is open source** and intended for users who prefer a desktop-first approach to ESPHome development, especially when dealing with multiple devices or structured project folders.

## üíæ Installation methods

### üîπ Option 1: Using the Windows Installer (recommended)

1. Download the `.exe` installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/esphomeGuieasy/releases) page
2. Run the installer and follow the wizard
3. The program will be installed in `Program Files` and added to the Start menu and Desktop
4. On first launch:
   - You will be prompted to select a language
   - A user configuration database will be created in:
     `%APPDATA%\ESPHomeGUIeasy\user_config.db`
   - A log file will be created at:
     `%APPDATA%\ESPHomeGUIeasy\esphomeguieasy_log.txt`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Notice:**  
Some antivirus (like Windows Defender) may **falsely flag** the installer or `.exe` (e.g. *Phonzy.A!ml*).  
This is a **false positive**, due to the unsigned nature and embedded Python runtime.  
You can safely click **"More info ‚Üí Run anyway"** when prompted by SmartScreen.

  - Make sure you activated the `venv` before installing requirements
  - Try: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- **'esphome' not found**
  - Ensure it's installed globally via `pip install esphome`

- **Permission error on serial ports (Linux/macOS):**
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG dialout $(whoami)
  ```

- **Unexpected error or crash**
  - Open an issue and provide:
    - OS and version
    - Python version
    - Full error log

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
core/ # YAML, flash, logging logic
gui/ # PyQt6 interface components
assets/ # Icons and graphics
config/ # Boards, templates
main.py # Entry point (called from ESPHomeRunner.exe or .bat)
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Where user files are stored

After installation, the application creates the following directory for configuration and logs:

%APPDATA%\ESPHomeGUIeasy\

- `user_config.db` ‚Äî contains language and startup preferences
- `esphomeguieasy_log.txt` ‚Äî contains startup logs and crash info

This folder is fully writable by the user. You can delete it to reset the application to first-launch state.
