## üíæ Installation methods

### üîπ Option 1: Using the Windows Installer (recommended for most users)

1. Download the `.exe` installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/esphomeGuieasy/releases) page
2. Run the installer and follow the wizard
3. The program will be installed in `Program Files` and added to the Start menu and optionally the Desktop
4. On first launch, a folder will be created in your `Documents` for community projects and configuration

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Notice:**  
Some antivirus (like Windows Defender) may **falsely flag the installer or `.exe` file** as a potential threat (e.g. *Phonzy.A!ml*).  
This is a **false positive**, due to the embedded Python environment and unsigned nature of the installer.  
You can safely allow it, or run the program directly from source.

---

### üîπ Option 2: Running from source

#### 1. Prerequisites
- Python **3.10 or higher** ([download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) globally installed:
  ```bash
  pip install esphome
  ```
- OS: **Windows, Linux, macOS**

#### 2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/esphomeGuieasy.git
cd esphomeGuieasy
```

#### 3. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate      # On macOS/Linux
```

#### 4. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 5. Run the app
```bash
python main.py
```
