üìù Description

**ESPHomeGUIeasy** is a standalone desktop application written in Python with a modern PyQt6 interface, designed to simplify how you create, configure, and deploy firmware for **ESPHome-compatible devices** (ESP32, ESP8266, etc.).

It provides a full **visual workflow** ‚Äî from device configuration to firmware flashing ‚Äî with no need to write YAML manually (but you can if you want to).

Whether you're a beginner in home automation or a power user managing multiple devices, ESPHomeGUIeasy makes the process easier, faster, and more organized.

### üí° Key Features

- üß± **Visual ‚Äúblock-style‚Äù editor**  
  Drag & drop preconfigured sensor/action blocks ‚Äî no YAML syntax needed

- ‚úçÔ∏è **Live YAML preview & editing**  
  The interface updates YAML as you go ‚Äî and you can still tweak it manually

- üñ•Ô∏è **Cross-platform UI**  
  Clean and responsive PyQt6-based GUI, available in multiple languages (EN, IT, ES, DE)

- üìÑ **Project Manager** *(since v1.4.0)*  
  Organize projects by category with metadata, changelogs, and quick actions

- üîå **Integrated Flashing**  
  Supports USB and OTA uploads with built-in log viewer

- üß∞ **Console with build logs**  
  Real-time output while building and flashing firmware

- üìÅ **Local project folder & YAML structure**  
  Compatible with ESPHome CLI structure

- üíæ **Works out of the box**  
  No Python installation or venv required ‚Äî ships with Python embedded

---

**ESPHomeGUIeasy is open source** and intended for users who prefer a desktop-first approach to ESPHome development, especially when dealing with multiple devices or structured project folders.

## üíæ Installation

### üîπ Option 1: Using the Windows Installer (recommended)

1. Download the `.exe` installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/esphomeGuieasy/releases) page
2. Run the installer and follow the wizard
3. The program will be installed in `Program Files` and added to the Start menu and Desktop
4. On first launch:
   - You will be prompted to select a language
   - A user configuration database will be created in:
     `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ESPHomeGUIeasy\user_config.db`
   - A log file will be created at:
     `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ESPHomeGUIeasy\esphomeguieasy_log.txt`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Notice:**  
Some antivirus (like Windows Defender) may **falsely flag** the installer or `.exe` (e.g. *Phonzy.A!ml*).  
This is a **false positive**, due to the unsigned nature and embedded Python runtime.  
You can safely click **"More info ‚Üí Run anyway"** when prompted by SmartScreen.

## üß∞ Dependencies (already bundled in embedded build)

- **PyQt6** ‚Äî graphical interface
- **ruamel.yaml** ‚Äî YAML handling
- **pyserial** ‚Äî serial port communication

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting

- **The program doesn't start**
  - Check that it was extracted correctly and not blocked by antivirus
  - Run from terminal to capture output: `ESPHomeGUIeasy.exe > log.txt 2>&1`

- **'esphome' not found**
  - Ensure `esphome` is installed and available in PATH
  - Or use the internal ESPHome bundled with the GUI

- **Permission error on serial ports (Linux/macOS):**
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG dialout $(whoami)
  ```

## üóÇÔ∏è Where user files are stored

After installation, the application creates the following directory:

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ESPHomeGUIeasy\`

- `user_config.db` ‚Äî configuration and language settings
- `esphomeguieasy_log.txt` ‚Äî full session log

This folder is fully writable and persistent between runs. Delete it to reset the app.
