## üìù Description

**esphomeGuieasy** is a Python desktop app with PyQt6 interface to simplify the creation, editing and flashing of ESPHome-compatible devices.

- Local and OTA flashing
- Board and template management

## üíæ Installation methods

### üîπ Option 1: Using the Windows Installer (recommended)

1. Download the `.exe` installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/esphomeGuieasy/releases) page
2. Run the installer and follow the wizard
3. The program will be installed in `Program Files` and added to the Start menu and Desktop
4. On first launch:
   - You will be prompted to select a language
   - A user configuration database will be created in:
     `%APPDATA%\ESPHomeGUIeasy\user_config.db`
   - A log file will be created at:
     `%APPDATA%\ESPHomeGUIeasy\esphomeguieasy_log.txt`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Notice:**  
Some antivirus (like Windows Defender) may **falsely flag** the installer or `.exe` (e.g. *Phonzy.A!ml*).  
This is a **false positive**, due to the unsigned nature and embedded Python runtime.  
You can safely click **"More info ‚Üí Run anyway"** when prompted by SmartScreen.
