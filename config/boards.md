@page boards Supported Boards

@brief JSON configuration file containing the list of supported development boards.

This file is used by the ESPHomeGUIeasy project to populate the **board selector**
during the creation of a new project.

Each entry in the file provides a human-readable label (shown in the GUI) and
the internal identifier (`board:`) used by ESPHome in the YAML configuration.
